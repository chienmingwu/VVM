# Makefile.host:  defines processor-dependent information
# This file is intended to be read by GNUmakefile.
# See the comments in GNUmakefile for more information.
#
# This Makefile should define the following variables:
#
#     CPP	full path name of the C preprocessor
#     FC	full path name of the Fortran compiler
#     LD	full path name of the loader (usually the same as FC)
#     AR	full path name of the archiver 
#
# The following variables may also be defined.  However, you may choose
# to override these on the make command line (e.g., make 'FFLAGS=-i8' ).
# You may want to set some of these differently based on whether or not
# the variable DEBUG is defined (see examples below).
#
#     CPPFLAGS	flags to be passed to CPP (for .F files)
#     SUF	suffix to use for files generated from .F via CPP
#     FFLAGS	flags to be passed to FC
#     FIXED	extra option(s) passed to FC to specify fixed source
#     FREE	extra option(s) passed to FC to specify free  source
#     LDLIBS	libraries to pass to the loader
#     LDFLAGS	other flags to pass to the loader
#
# You must also define one of the processor flags identifying the 
# system which will be passed to CPP (see further comments below).
#
# This version of Makefile.host uses the name (OS) of the operating system
# (as returned by the system command uname) to identify which system we're 
# running on.  The whole file could simply be replaced by a hard-coded 
# version specific to your current system, or you could check ($HOST), etc.
#
# Notes:
#
#     Values for OS (operating system) other than Linux and SunOS are 
#     guesses based on values found in the original makefile (not tested).
#     This will probably need some tweaking to run on those systems.
